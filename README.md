# Tic-Tac-Toe
This C++ implementation of Tic-Tac-Toe provides a solid foundation for understanding game development concepts and the use of arrays in programming.

# Description

Tic-Tac-Toe, also known as Noughts and Crosses, is a simple yet strategic game for two players. 

The objective is to form a line of three identical symbols (either 'X' or 'O') horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. 

This C++ implementation provides both single-player and two-player modes, offering a fun and challenging experience.

# Methodology 

- 2-D character array (3x3)
- Loops
- Functions
